        <section id="INTRO">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <p>If you’re like me, the morning consists of constantly checking my watch as I quickly shove cereal in my mouth, ensuring I’m not late for the bus, a large amount of time spent fumbling around in my pockets for my phone that is always in the second pocket I check, and approximately five minutes of untangling a set of old wired, yes wired, earphones before jamming them in my ears to listen to the same playlist I do every morning on my way to work. Till of late, I hadn’t thought a thing about any of it, until my old Garmin sports watch broke, and my younger sister pointed out that wired earphones aren’t cool anymore. Firstly, “anymore” was a surprise to me. I didn’t realise they used to be “cool”, and secondly, I had always thought of earphones as a functional tool to make the grey mornings bearable, not a fashion statement.</p>
            <p>Today a watch is not just for telling the time or tracking your splits, it is about matching it to your outfit, representing a brand, or expressing your identity. Unnoticed by many, myself included, this seamless fusion of technology and style epitomises an era marked by unparalleled technological advancements. The interaction between fashion and technology has birthed and redefined the creation of the transformative genre of wearable technology. </p>
            <p>We will rewind to the beginning of a blossoming relationship connecting technology and fashion. Explore the drama that separated them, the moments that brought them back together. But most importantly, we will try to answer the question of how the integration of fashion and technology affects the functionality of wearable devices.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="TFOF">
            <h3>The Function of Form</h3>

            <p>“Form ever follows function” is a famous maxim coined by architect <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Sullivan" target="_blank">Louis Sullivan</a> (1856–1924). The design principle suggests that the shape or appearance of the object should primarily be based on its <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jcraniofacialsurgery/citation/2020/04000/form_follows_function,_function_follows_form.4.aspx" target="_blank">intended purpose or function</a> <sup>[1]</sup>. The phrase is often associated with modernist architecture and industrial design but is part of the foundations of today’s design. Wearable technology has existed for many centuries. However, its success has almost always depended on how well it adhered to this paradigm. At a base level, for a device to succeed, it must function appropriately while also remaining relevant to the current fashion.</p>
            <p>The roots of wearable technology can be traced back to the 16th century with the emergence of the pocket watch, a precursor to contemporary wearables. In a notable instance from 1572, Queen Elizabeth I received a wristband embedded with a small watch from Robert Dudley <sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
            <p>This represents one of the first pivotal moments for wearable technology and its interconnection with fashion. According to Miranda Wilson’s <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/erc/46/1/article-p44_44.xml" target="_blank">Explorations in Renaissance Culture</a>, watchmakers faced the challenge of persuading Elizabeth I of the usefulness of a portable watch as she thought of it only as a display of sovereignty <sup>[ibid]</sup>. While the pocket watch was originally designed for timekeeping, it quickly transcended its utilitarian role, becoming a stylish accessory and symbol of status. Its existence can be attributed to its ability to work simply, but its success can be attributed to its ability to function not only as a timekeeping device, but also as one that can be encrusted in your favourite colour, engraved with your initials, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/09/fashion/jurmo-watches-customization-finland.html" target="_blank">personalised to your greatest desire.</a></p>
            <p>To say that technology is not designed to look good would be a fallacy. In fact, the aesthetic appeal of our devices is becoming an increasingly pivotal aspect of their overall design. This emphasis on appearance aligns with the changing dynamics of consumer expectations, where technology is not merely a tool but an expression of personal style and identity. In <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Everyday-Things-MIT-Press/dp/0262525674" target="_blank">The Design of Everyday Things</a> <sup>[3]</sup>, Donald A. Norman’s insights into design psychology resonate in this context. He discusses the importance of aesthetics in conjunction with functionality. Devices that not only perform admirably but also engage the user visually are more likely to be embraced. The pocket watch, mentioned earlier, serves as an early example of this symbiosis between functionality and aesthetics. Its success was not solely rooted in its timekeeping abilities, but also in how it seamlessly integrated into the wearer’s ensemble, becoming a fashionable accessory.</p>
            <p>However, as our technology advances, there is a risk of design losing sight of its primary goal: functionality. The discussion around the <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/sp706?locale=en_US" target="_blank">iPhone 6 Plus</a> being too large for pockets becomes a pertinent case in point. <a href="https://medium.com/@sachinrekhi/don-normans-principles-of-interaction-design-51025a2c0f33" target="_blank">Norman’s principles</a>, rooted in the idea of visibility, constraints, and discoverability, highlight the potential pitfalls when form overshadows function <sup>[ibid]</sup>.</p>
            <p>In 2014, Apple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T2HCbv9FBQ" target="_blank">announced the release</a> of its new generation of iPhone, the event was widely publicised and the latest addition to their offering, the iPhone 6 Plus, received mixed reviews due to its revolutionarily large size. One reporter coined the term “phablet” in their post, discussing the growing size of mobile devices. The iPhone 6, along with other large phones such as the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z_ultra-5540.php" target="_blank">Sony Xperia Ultra</a> and <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_mega_6_3_i9200-5398.php" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Mega</a>, seem relatively small in comparison to the phones we carry today, but at the time, this caused real controversy <sup>[4]</sup>. <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/home" target="_blank">Uniqlo</a>, a large Japanese clothing brand, was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/bigger-phones-bigger-pockets-fashion-retailers-redesign-trousers-for-iphone-6-plus-9767547.html" target="_blank"></a>quoted as saying</a>, “We are having conversations currently with the product development team regarding technology overall, and how our clothes can provide compatibility from a user perspective. Jean pockets is one of those conversations”<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>
            <p>In a study conducted by Nokia called <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1656800" target="_blank">“Where is the Phone?"</a> A study of mobile phone location in public spaces.”<sup>[6]</sup> documents interviews with over 300 people in 6 major cities across the world. The aim was to understand where people place their phones, how size affects their storage, and gather insights on daily use. The results showed a strong tendency by gender, with females using their bags and males using their pockets to place their mobile phones. These results show a correlation between pocket availability and size and the chance of pocket storage. Females also reported missing more notifications when they placed their phones in their bags and a large amount of comments were made about wishing they had larger pockets.</p>
            <p>While large phones have not been a failure, these findings shed light on an interesting interaction between technology and fashion. In this example, the functionality created by larger screens and its incompatibility with fashion has become why the device performs poorly. Although it seems the resolution to this issue would be to increase the size of people’s pockets, the design of the device should take into consideration the third-party context that it will inhabit, and adapt and conform to that environment.</p>

            <h3>Rise in Customisation of Technology</h3>
            
            <p>Today, the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html" target="_blank">rapid growth</a> of the Information and Communications Technology sector reflects the equally enormous growth of handheld devices and wearable technology <sup>[7]</sup>. This influx of technology has profoundly transformed how we live, ushering in an era of connectivity and digital integration. The omnipresence of handheld devices, such as smartphones and tablets, has revolutionised communication, information access, and entertainment. However, with this rapid growth, large companies dominate the ecosystem, creating a monoculture of expression.</p>
            <p>The Cambridge Dictionary describes fashion as "a style that is popular at a particular time, especially in clothes, hair, make-up" <sup>[8]</sup>, but I believe fashion encompasses much more than the latest trends. In Malcolm Barnard’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fashion-Theory-Routledge-Student-Readers/dp/0415413400" target="_blank">Fashion Theory</a>, he discusses how fashion is an amalgamation of “social norms, individual self-expression, and technology” <sup>[9]</sup>. Deconstructing fashion in this sense further supports the idea of the interwoven relationship between fashion and technology, but also brings to light the issue in this age of technological proliferation with a cookie-cutter approach of mass-produced devices creating a bottleneck for self-expression. In this section, we will look at the customisation of technology, how users have tailored their devices to reflect their unique tastes, preferences and identities, and how this demand for personalisation and individuality has its effects on the tech industry and the products they produce.</p>
            <p>The term wearables or wearable devices refers to small electronic and mobile devices, or computers with wireless communications capability that are incorporated into gadgets, accessories, or clothes, which can be worn on the human body, or even invasive versions such as microchips or smart tattoos <sup>[10]</sup>. However, there once was a time when devices like these did not exist. In the infancy of wearables, we can see one of the first notable instances of customisation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Nano" target="_blank">the iPod nano</a>. The iPod nano garnered substantial support with its initial introduction in 2005. The iPod nano was a small portable media player with its main purpose being as an MP3 player <sup>[11]</sup>. Not long after its release, the iPod nano acquired a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-K-piRoT8A" target="_blank">cult following</a>, a group that aimed to modify and “upgrade” the functionality of the device by making it wearable. The idea was that by adding a wristband, the device could function as a portable wristwatch, allowing users to stylishly display any clock face they wanted while also being capable of listening to their favourite music. Seemingly the perfect mix, this primitive smartwatch was not ignored by Apple. The iPod nano, a small cube-shaped device with its existence rooted in its ability to play music and the occasional game of Pong, had transformed into a fashionable watch that <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/why-my-new-digital-watch-is-an-ipod-nano/" target="_blank">people</a> thought was “pretty damn cool”.</p>
            <p>A few years later, Apple would release their official version of the smartwatch that would build off the adapted iPod Nano many had fallen in love with. Today <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch" target="_blank">Apple’s smartwatches</a> offer numerous features, from emergency services to sleep tracking. The success of the Apple Watch not only demonstrates the adaptability of technology, but also highlights the significance of user-driven innovation, and the ability to customise it from a fashion perspective <sup>[12]</sup>. This is a prime example of how a user’s interest in self-expression and technology will drive them to customise an existing product and, in turn, influence the future development of that product, creating a clear visualisation for the ever-present conversation between fashion and technology.</p>
            <p>Putting your phone in a coloured case, changing the face on your watch, plastering your headphones with doodles and stickers. Customisation of devices is something we all do in one form or another. We have already looked at how users will go outside the parameters of a device to extend its function or upgrade its fashionability, but customisation is ever more being natively integrated into our devices. Sampada Marathe investigates the intricacy of customisation in digital devices in her research paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978942.1979056" target="_blank">“What Drives Customisation? Control Or Identity?”</a>. We discussed the importance of customisation in allowing self-expression. However, within this paper, Sampada questions the purpose of personalisation. Whether it allows people to feel in control or build a relationship with their device, and if all this has a major effect on driving usage. Within her research, she identified five overarching reasons why users feel the need to engage in customisation:” 1) To make a system’s goals fit their own 2) To make the system more efficient 3) to manage complexity 4) to dictate outcome and 5) to manage information overload”. Many of these changes, particularly 2, 3, and 4, were perceived, but had no actual effect. Based on this and other research, Sampada continues to argue that although “these customisation actions are supposed to be ancillary to a primary activity. However, evidence suggests that they are becoming a primary activity themselves”.</p> 
            <p>It is evident that in this instance, customisation stands for a lot more than just a visual or functional upgrade, but one that allows users to redefine their form of interaction and although this has a large effect on the functionality of wearable devices it important that we look closely at it from a fashion perspective, one driven by visuals and form. Customisation has allowed users to shape and mould their devices into themselves through the use of backgrounds, cases, ringtones, and so much more. The idea that users spend the majority of time personalising their <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207122" target="_blank">widgets</a> and components suggests that for a significant portion of the population, these wearables are not just tools but extensions of their style and identity. Devices, and more specifically wearable devices, are designed with people in mind. To cater to the evolving needs of the public, devices must be created with customisation in mind. Technology is great and everyone wants a working product, but what people want most is a product they can call theirs.</p>
            <p>In response to whether customisation affects the functionality of a product and, in continuation, the sales generated, we can confidently answer yes. In a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/bto/pdf/mobt32_02-09_masscustom_r4.ashx#:~:text=True%20scale%20in%20mass%20customization,customized%20production%20(Exhibit%202)." target="_blank">study</a> and article conducted by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/" target="_blank">McKinsey and Company</a>, we can see that personalisation increases sales by 22 to 30 per cent <sup>[13]</sup>. Although contrastingly, they identify the inherent risk in allowing customisations and the supply chain issues this can cause. McKinsey also states that the utilisation of customisations helps “rejuvenate stagnant markets”. This point reflects the comments made in Malcolm Barnard’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fashion-Theory-Routledge-Student-Readers/dp/0415413400" target="_blank">Fashion Theory</a> paper, which suggests fashion is about creating an identity within a saturated environment <sup>[9]</sup>.</p>
            <p>The research into this effectiveness of customisation can be visualised in the market today. Various companies are working together to offer a wide variety of options for their consumers. Collaborations, such as the one between <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/09/apple-nike-launch-apple-watch-nike/" target="_blank">Nike and Apple</a> with their Apple watch <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch/nike-sport-band" target="_blank">bands</a>, allow users to represent the brands they like, while also increasing the variety of options available while brands also strive towards creating a customisable ecosystem, allowing users to engrave names, customise colours and choose from a selection of materials.</p>
            <p>One article states that “Simple design is dead. Welcome to Apple’s era of customisation” <sup>[14]</sup>. With the increase in customisation to allow for the freedom of expression and individualised fashion, this article argues that Apple is “inching away from the very design thesis upon which Steve Jobs founded the company: that technology should be reduced to its most essential components to reach the largest number of users”. While this may be true, is it for the worse? To argue that having a mass-produced device unified in function and design is better for the market is a tough hill to die on. Individualism, as seen in customisation, allows people to possess an identity, self-awareness, and have a purpose. One point in Mark Wilson’s article does stand is that as customisation expands the responsibility of the overall design and function becomes the burden of the individual customer, he states “It’s a job most of us can’t possibly do as well as Apple” <sup>[ibid]</sup>.</p>
            <p>We have broken down customisation into two forms, unintentional and planned, and analysed how these have changed the development of technology, as well as shaped how the tech market looks in today’s climate. It is possible to identify from these examples a distinct movement towards an era of customisation where technology is, if not solely, strongly considered an integral part of fashion. What resonates so clearly with this integration of customisation into almost every facet of technology is the desire to create something personal, unique, and identifiable. Creating more than something that everybody has but an item that represents you. The examples we covered depict the influence of customisation and further strengthen the argument that fashion plays a key role in the development of wearable technology.</p>

            <h3>The Future of Technology and Fashion</h3>
            
            <p>Within a short period, wearables have become a staple in people’s daily wear, from the advent of the quartz watch to the recent advancements of <a href="https://www.volersystems.com/blog/the-future-of-wearable-tech-7-ways-ar-and-vr-are-pushing-innovation" target="_blank">VR</a> and implants, the rapid development of technology paired with the latest trends makes it difficult to comprehend what the future holds. Large tech companies have focused their attention on VR headsets, hoping to unlock the next level of wearables.</p>
            <p>Technology and fashion are developing at an unprecedented pace, bringing on an era where wearables seamlessly integrate into our daily lives. From the humble beginnings of the quartz watch, to the cutting-edge innovations of virtual reality and implants, the symbiotic relationship between technology and fashion has transcended everything we could have imagined.</p>
            <p>As we look to the future, it becomes evident that tech companies are currently directing their focus towards the development of VR headsets. Previously attempted by companies such as Google, with <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/glass/start/" target="_blank">Google Glass</a>, this unfamiliar territory offers a brand new landscape of challenges and opportunities ripe for exploration. Unlike devices like the smartwatch, whose predecessor, the wristwatch, paved the way for establishing a universally recognised form, VR headsets sit in a grey zone. Their form resembles that of a pair of ski goggles, yet they share little to no functional resemblance, creating an awkward clunky aesthetic that currently has not been received too well within fashion. This naivety regarding design is to be expected with new technology, but one thing is for sure, and that is that technology, especially wearable technology, is becoming more compact and lightweight. <a href="https://www.gearpatrol.com/watches/a476444/small-watch-trend/" target="_blank">Watches are becoming thinner</a>, medical wearables are becoming lighter, and numerous functionalities are being consolidated into a single device.</p>
            <p>The future in terms of technological advancement can be quite difficult to predict, however, fashion and how that affects the future direction of our wearables follows a recurring pattern. </p>
            <p>According to insights presented in research and <a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/wearables/the-future-of-wearable-technology/1/" target="_blank">educational materials</a> published by <a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/" target="_blank">GCFGlobal</a>, an online research and learning centre, evidence suggests that devices are following the course towards becoming less and less visible <sup>[15]</sup>. As these devices continue to capture the imagination of users and integrate seamlessly into our daily lives, the once obvious appearance of fitness watches and sports tracks may give way to a generation of wearables. Wearables that may assume the guise of jewellery, a pair of glasses or even be integrated within the fabric of our clothes.</p>
            <p>We could consider this evolution of wearables to be a matter of aesthetics. However, I believe it reflects the integration of technology into our lives. The desire is for wearables to become more than just a gadget strapped to your wrist or built into a headband, but rather an extension of personal style.</p>
            <p>We can see this shift already with companies, such as <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/c/wearables-smartwatches/" target="_blank">Garmin</a>, having dedicated lines of smartwatches disguised as classical analogue watches. With the watch being <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/785411">described</a> as a “Stylish hybrid smartwatch”, it’s clear to see the influence of fashion on the tech industry, yet we are only at the beginning of this phenomenon. Other devices, such as safety wearables, that allow users to alert friends and family of their location, are being concealed as rings and necklaces. As this trend proliferates the market, the question is, how far will this condensation and transformation of the wearable device go?</p>
            <p>In the rise of customisation, we discussed the definition of wearable technology. This definition mentioned that wearables could take the form of “invasive versions such as microchips”, which is something we have not covered. Due to the advanced nature of this category, implanted devices are uncommon in the market, and current research and discovery directs its focus toward implanted medical devices, however in a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9268/6/4/20" target="_blank">paper</a> written by Katrine Lundager she discussed the technological limitations holding embedded wearable devices off the market. Among many, the largest problem is the lack of available small power storage systems <sup>[16]</sup>. Although a large issue, following the technological progression pattern, she predicts that this issue will be solved in the near future. But how does this affect wearables as a whole? It could be argued that the creation of implantable wearables causes the flourishing relationship between fashion and technology to become obsolete. However, we have seen previously that new mediums tend to offer new pathways for expression, especially fashion.</p>

        <section id="CONC">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>We looked at Louis Sullivan’s maxim, “form ever follows function” <sup>[1]</sup> its effect on the development and birth of wearable technology, but how this has also been misinterpreted as design lacking importance. This becomes apparent in the context of larger phones. The continuous change propelled plays a crucial role in shaping how fashion contributes to the development of wearable devices.</p>
            <p>Although I believe to a certain extent the maxim still stands true, the way in which it has been misconstrued results in functional objects that feel lost. Form, and in turn fashion, are required to create a sense of personality that allows users to connect with the object. Technology has evolved beyond the phase of features alone defining its function and into an era where the aesthetics of the device are also considered integral to its function.If we assess the success of fashion in technology based on the current tech market, it becomes challenging to deny that this symbiosis significantly enhances the functionality of wearables.</p>
            <p>Although not always obvious, this dialogue between fashion and technology shapes the way we interact with our devices. With the introduction of mass customisation, it has evolved the meaning of a function device and with the technology becoming smaller, it will begin to inhabit the form of fashion even more as seen with the transformation of digital watches.</p>
            <p>When I order my new watch, I still care about how well it tells the time and whether I can track my runs, but I also care about how well it represents me. While I don't want anything too serious, I want something I can wear to any occasion. I care how it looks. I care how people perceive the technology I wear. The desire to have something functional yet fashionable is not always something at the forefront of your mind. But it is always a subconscious thought process that creates a bias towards certain products that can be seen reflected in wearable technology on the market today.</p>
            <p>My sister might not like the watch I wear or think that the headphones I bought are cool, but to me they are. They represent my personality; they make me an individual and they make me feel good. Fashion removes that cold, robotic, function driven aspect of technology, softening the bluntness of mass produced wearables so that everyone can enjoy them in their own way.</p>
